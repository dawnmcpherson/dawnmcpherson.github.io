		<h1>FAQ's</h1>
		<h4> We've done our best to try and anticipate the questions you may ask. If we have forgotten something, let us know! Contact Us! We'd love to hear from you.

		<h4>We currently offer different produce bags which consist of all Certified Organic Produce. We are unable to give you an exact amount or poundage of food per bag, but please feel free to check out the photographs of our previous week's bags to get an idea of how much to expect!  Our goal is to purchase as local as possible.  When choosing our produce, we look for the items available in our region first, keeping in mind member's requests and variety.</h4>
		<div class="qa">
		<p class="q"><span>Q: </span>What are the payment options?</p>
		<p class="a"><span>A: </span>We currently offer cash or PayPal&reg as payment options. PayPal&reg Customers: In order to accept PayPal&reg you must follow some guidelines. We only accept “gifted” funds through PayPal&reg. This helps us keep costs down. Please make sure that you only use this option when paying by credit or debit card through PayPal&reg. If paying by PayPal&reg, bags must be prepaid for as indicated below:</p>

		<div class="qa">
		<p class="q"><b>Q: </b>How do I gift the funds in PayPal&reg?</p>
		<p class="a"><b>A: </b>PayPal&reg recently changed some of their terminology.  When "gifting" the funds, select Send Money.  Then, input the PayPal&reg email of CountyRoadCoOp@gmail.com, the amount of your purchase, and click "send money to friends or family". Keep in mind the screens are different between the computer and mobile devices. Please note that you will be responsible for any additional fees charged by PayPal&reg.  All PayPal&reg payments must be received no later than 8:00pm the day before pick up.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="qa">
		<p class="q"><span><b>Q: </b></span>I sent the funds via PayPal&reg.  Can you confirm receipt of the funds?</p>
		<p class="a"><span><b>A: </b></span>PayPal&reg gives their users access to payment statuses.  Please log in to your PayPal&reg account to view if a payment has been sent.  Unless a member has a specific issue or concern with their PayPal&reg payment, we highly encourage our members to check the status of a payment by logging in their PayPal&reg account.
		</div>
		<div class="qa">
		<p class="q"><span>Q: </span>I don't have PayPal&reg, is there another way to pay?</p>
		<p class="a"><span>A: </span>We also accept cash at pick up. If you choose to pay at pick up and fail to show up, we will require you to prepay for all future orders.  This requirement is because the produce must be paid for upfront and we cannot return unsold produce.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="qa">
		<p class="q"><span>Q: </span>How do I order?</p>
		<p class="a"><span>A: </span>We typically keep the current available order form posted in our Group under “pinned posts” which is found at the top of our page.  Simply click on the order form to complete your responses to reserve your bag(s).  We are currently accepting orders for pick up on Mondays and Thursdays.  You may also contact us via email at CountyRoadCoOp@gmail.com to place your orders.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="qa">
		<p class="q"><span>Q: </span>Can I swap items in my bag if I don't want something or want more of something else?</p>
		<p class="a"><span>A: </span>Each week we will post a Trade/Allergy form.  You may comment on the post to notify members of the trade you seek.  Once a trade has been agreed upon, please complete the Trade and Allergy form for that given week to ensure the trade is completed.  If the form is not completed, the trade will not occur. Trades and swaps must only occur in the thread where the swap form is posted.  This will eliminate confusion between pick up days.  </p>

		<div class="qa">
		<p class="q"><span>Q: </span>Do you offer half-sized bags?</p>
		<p class="a"><span>A: </span>Our current offers are one size, however you are welcome to post on the group page to see if someone else would like to split a bag with you!  :)</p>
		</div>
		<div class="qa">
		<p class="q"><span>Q: </span>Cool bag, can I keep it?</p>
		<p class="a"><span>A: </span>Sure, but if you don't bring it to pick up, you will be charged 2 extra dollars.</p>
